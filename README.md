# Movie-App
Created an Android app using Java, that shows a list of the latest movies that I have seen.
Has various functions including a short click that takes you to the sites Wiki page, and a long click that allows you to choose from three different options,
including a full screen view, wiki page, and a list of streaming services to watch the movie. This also works in landscape mode.
